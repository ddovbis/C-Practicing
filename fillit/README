Terminal commands:
make - create file "fillit"
make re - remake file fillit
make fclean - delete file

./fillit test_valid/two_pieces - test program with example of valid two pieces.
In folder are also other examples of valid pieces (from two to eight).

./fillit test_err/err00 - test programm with example of invalid piece.

The description of a Tetriminos must respect the following rul:
• Precisely 4 lines of 4 characters followed by a new line.
• A Tetriminos is a classic piece of Tetris composed of 4 blocks.
• Each character must be either a ’#’ when the character is one of the 4 blocks of a Tetriminos or a ’.’ if it’s empty.
• Each block of a Tetriminos must be in contact with at least one other block on any of his 4 sides.

A few examples of valid descriptions of Tetriminos:
....    ....    ####    ....    .##.    ....    .#..    ....    ....
..##    ....    ....    ....    ..##    .##.    ###.    ##..    .##.
..#.    ..##    ....    ##..    ....    ##..    ....    #...    ..#.
..#.    ..##    ....    ##..    ....    ....    ....    #...    ..#.

A few examples of invalid descriptions of Tetriminos:
####    ...#    ##...   #.      ....    ..##    ####    ,,,,    .HH.
...#    ..#.    ##...   ##      ....    ....    ####    ####    HH..
....    .#..    ....    #.      ....    ....    ####    ,,,,    ....
....    #...    ....            ....    ##..    ####    ,,,,    ....

Program output
Program must display the smallest square solution on the standard output. To identify each Tetriminos in the square solution, it will assign a capital letter (starting with ’A’) to each Tetriminos in the order they appear in the file. A file will contain 26 Tetriminos maximum.
If the file contains at least one error, program will display error on the standard output and will exit properly.
